<div><h1>A11Y Style Guide</h1>
<p>This application is a living style guide, generated from <abbr title="Knyle Style Sheets">KSS</abbr> documented styles...with an accessibility twist. See a <a href="http://a11y-style-guide.com/style-guide" target="_blank" aria-label="Accessibility style guide demo">live demo</a> of the style guide.</p></div>

<div><h2>How this all got started</h2>

<p>We wear a lot of hats as front-end developers. Depending on the client or company you work for, you may be the designer, UX/UI specialist, site-builder, QA tester, and developer all rolled into one. How can we possibly add the accessibility hat on top of all that? What accessible pieces should we even include? Which pieces are easy wins vs. impossible juggernauts? How do we implement inclusive design and development when a project does not have a lot of time or budget to include that piece?</p>

<p>One way we can tackle these issues is by using an accessible component driven approach. By thinking about inclusiveness from the start, we can get a head start on accessibility while still building the required site components.</p>

<p>The A11Y style guide comes with pre-populated accessible components that include helpful links to related tools, articles, and WCAG guidelines to make your site more inclusive. These components also serve as a guide for both HTML markup and SCSS/CSS code, to inform designers, front-end and back-end developers at every stage of the website’s creation.</p></div>

<div><h2>Where to begin?</h2>
<p>This has a <abbr title="Knyle Style Sheets">KSS</abbr> node base, so learn a bit about <a href="https://github.com/kss-node/kss-node/wiki/Quick-Start-Guide" target="_blank">how KSS node works</a></p>
<p>To make local changes to components, do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fork the project</li>
<li>Navigate to the project root</li>
<li><code>nvm install stable</code> (only need to do once - see the <a href="https://github.com/creationix/nvm" target="_blank"><abbr title="node version manager">NVM</abbr> project</a> for troubleshooting)</li>
<li><code>nvm use stable</code></li>
<li><code>npm install</code> (only need to do once)</li>
<li><code>git checkout -b my-new-feature</code> (create your feature branch)</li>
<li>Make changes</li>
<li><code>npm run gulp</code> (this will run all the gulp commands)</li>
<li><code>git commit -A</code> (adds all changes)</li>
<li><code>git commit -m 'Add some feature'</code> (commit your changes)</li>
<li><code>git push origin my-new-feature</code> (push to the branch)</li>
<li>Create new Pull Request</li>
</ul>
<p>This will run all the gulp commands including the style guide update. If you want to contribute back, please do so! This is a great <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/git" target="_blank">Git resource</a> if you need to brush-up on your skills (all levels)</p></div>
